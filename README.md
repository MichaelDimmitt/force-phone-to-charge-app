# force-phone-to-charge-app

new phone app idea
it shuts off your phone
but it does more than that
tricks your phone to think the battery has run out
so you can only turn it back on by accessing a phone charger


this is probably impossible because not allowed by android or ios. 
but hopefully I can come up with a creative solution because I could use it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
